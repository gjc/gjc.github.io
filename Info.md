The venue is Bellfield which is the Old Portobello Old Parish Church, now bought by the community group Action Porty. As such, there is no parking at the venue itself. 

There is on-street parking in Portobello itself, however, you may wish to consider taking public transport or a taxi to the venue instead. 

There are excellent public transport links to Edinburgh and surrounding area. 

**By bus**: [Lothian bus 26](https://www.lothianbuses.com/timetable/?service_name=26) (and [Night bus N26](https://www.lothianbuses.com/timetable/?service_name=N26)) runs regularly between Edinburgh city centre and the main street of Portobello (next to the venue). Journey time is about half an hour.

**By Rail**: There are also (less frequent) Scotrail services between [Edinburgh Waverley and Brunstane Station](https://www.thetrainline.com/train-times/brunstane-to-edinburgh-waverley)(which itself is a 20 minute walk from the venue). 

**By Taxi**: There are a number of local taxi operators in Portobello, Edinburgh and the nearby area.
