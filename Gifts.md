We genuinely wish for nothing more than seeing you on the day. 

However, if you are considering getting us a gift, we would be very grateful.


Two years ago we bought our first house together.  As you may know, the house was (and remains) a source of a great number of projects! 
There are also bits and pieces that we would love for around the house. However, if we were to start to list them all, we would be here all day! 

As we continue to turn our first house into our first home, we would kindly welcome gift donations to our "first home fund", for example, by bank transfer to

* Account number: 8468486 
* s/c: 40-47-61 

or if you would to give a gift voucher, we have also set up a John Lewis gift voucher list which you can vist [<b>here</b>](https://www.johnlewisgiftlist.com/giftint/JSPs/GiftList/ListManagement/ListHolderLogin.jsp?source=em_GLSoccasionRegistrationvoucher___) (Gift List number: 767464)
